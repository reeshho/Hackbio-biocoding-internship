# 🚀 HackBio Biocoding Internship: Stage 0  

## 📝 About This Repository  
Welcome to my **Stage 0** submission for the **HackBio Biocoding Internship**! 🎉 This repository contains my first task as part of the program, where I wrote a simple Python script to introduce myself.  

## 🏆 Task Description  
For **Stage 0**, I was required to write a Python script that prints:  
✅ My **Name**  
✅ My **Slack Username**  
✅ My **Email**  
✅ My **Hobbies**  
✅ My **Country**  
✅ My **Discipline**  
✅ My **Preferred Programming Language**  

## 🔧 Steps I Followed  
1️⃣ **Set up the script** – Created a new Python file `stage_zero.py`.  
2️⃣ **Defined variables** – Assigned my details to different variables.  
3️⃣ **Used formatted printing** – Used an f-string to neatly display all the information.  
4️⃣ **Ran the script** – Executed the Python file to verify the output.  

## 💻 My Solution (Python Code)  
Here's the Python script I wrote:  

```python
# Stage 0 Task - HackBio Biocoding Internship

# Defining my details
name = "Priyanjali Chowdhury"
slack_username = "Priyanjali"
email = "priyanjali150803@gmail.com"
hobbies = "Listening to music"
country = "India"
discipline = "Bioinformatics"
programming_language = "Python"

# Printing the details
print(f"Name: {name}\nSlack Username: {slack_username}\nEmail: {email}\nHobbies: {hobbies}\nCountry: {country}\nDiscipline: {discipline}\nPreferred Programming Language: {programming_language}")
